# Testing

## Introduction

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that the application works as expected and helping to identify and fix issues early. This section covers Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End Tests.

## Unit Tests

### Overview

Unit tests focus on individual components or functions, ensuring that each part of the application behaves as expected. They are typically fast and isolated, making them ideal for catching issues early in the development process.

### Example

Here's an example of a unit test for a simple function using Jest.

```typescript
import { sum } from './sum';

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Integration Tests

### Overview

Integration tests focus on the interaction between different parts of the application. They ensure that various modules work together as expected. These tests are broader than unit tests and can catch issues that arise from the interaction between components.

### Example

Here's an example of an integration test using Jest and React Testing Library.

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import { App } from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
    render(<App />);
    const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Running Integration Tests

To run integration tests, use the same command as for unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## End-to-End Tests

### Overview

End-to-End (E2E) tests simulate real user scenarios, testing the entire application from start to finish. These tests ensure that the application works as a whole and can catch issues that other types of tests might miss.

### Example

Here's an example of an end-to-end test using Cypress.

```javascript
describe('My First Test', () => {
    it('Visits the app root url', () => {
        cy.visit('/');
        cy.contains('h1', 'Welcome to Your Vue.js + TypeScript App');
    });
});
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

## Conclusion

Testing is an integral part of the development process, helping to ensure the reliability and quality of the application. By incorporating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, you can catch issues early and maintain a high standard of code quality.
