## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **NLP** web app documentation! This document provides an overview of the key features, system requirements, and step-by-step instructions to get started with **NLP**.

### **Overview of NLP**

**NLP** is a powerful SAAS web application designed to provide cutting-edge Natural Language Processing solutions. It offers a range of features including text analysis, sentiment detection, language translation, and more.

### **Key Features**

- **User Management**: Manage users with different roles (Agency Owner, Admin, Subaccount User, Guest).
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained permissions for subaccount users.
- **Agency and Subaccount Management**: Create and manage multiple subaccounts within an agency.

## **System Requirements**

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Node.js >= 14.x
- npm >= 6.x
- MySQL >= 5.7
- Prisma CLI


## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the **NLP** web app:

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Install Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install a Database**: Set up MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

### **Installation Guide**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-web-app.git
    cd nlp-web-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/nlp"
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

4. **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

### **Running the Application**

1. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Open the Application**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Configuration**

Configure your application using the `prisma.schema` file. Below is a brief overview of the schema used in NLP:

### Prisma Schema

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

enum Role {
  AGENCY_OWNER
  AGENCY_ADMIN
  SUBACCOUNT_USER
  SUBACCOUNT_GUEST
}

enum Icon {
  settings
  chart
  calendar
  check
  chip
  compass
  database
  flag
  home
  info
  link
  lock
  messages
  notification
  payment
  power
  receipt
  shield
  star
  tune
  videorecorder
  wallet
  warning
  headphone
  send
  pipelines
  person
  category
  contact
  clipboardIcon
}

```

Customize your application settings by editing the configuration files located in the `config` directory.

## First Steps

### Create Your First User

Upon starting the server, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign up as the first user, who will automatically become the Agency Owner.

### Create an Agency

After logging in, create your agency by providing necessary details like name, logo, and contact information.

### Add Subaccounts

Under your agency, create subaccounts to manage different projects or departments.

### Assign Roles and Permissions

Assign roles to users and set permissions to control access levels within your agency and subaccounts.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up NLP. You're now ready to explore the powerful features of this application. Dive into managing your agencies and subaccounts efficiently and effectively. Stay tuned for more detailed guides and tutorials.


```js
// Example of starting the server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
``
